# miracle generator

A little web art project inspired by [Hallie Bateman's "It's a miracle we ever met"](http://halliebateman.com/project/865/).

## get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

## my first sveltejs app

This is based on a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.
